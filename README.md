# handwriting-recognition_project
This project uses pytesseract and OpenCV to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on an image. It extracts text and bounding box coordinates for each character in the image, then draws rectangles and labels around each character on the image. This can be useful for various applications involving text extraction from images.
